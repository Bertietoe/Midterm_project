                <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>

                <p>Climate change refers to significant and lasting changes in the average temperature and weather patterns of Earth. While the climate has changed throughout history, human activities are now accelerating these changes at an unprecedented rate.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Why is Climate Change Happening?</h2>
                <p>The primary cause of current climate change is the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities, particularly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Burning Fossil Fuels:</strong> Activities such as electricity generation, transportation, and industry release carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Trees absorb CO2; cutting them down reduces the planet's capacity to absorb these gases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Farming practices, especially livestock production, contribute to emissions of methane and nitrous oxide.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images/greenhouse_effect.jpg" alt="Greenhouse Effect Diagram" />
                <p>These activities lead to an enhanced greenhouse effect, trapping more heat in the atmosphere and causing global temperatures to rise.</p>

                <h2>Fossil Fuel Reserves</h2>
                <p>It is estimated that there are about 50 years' worth of accessible fossil fuels left. According to the <a href="https://www.worldenergy.org/" target="_blank">World Energy Council</a>, global fossil fuel reserves (coal, oil, and natural gas) will last only a few more decades if consumption continues at current rates. This alarming statistic underscores the need for a transition to sustainable energy sources.</p>

                <h2>Country Facts</h2>
                <p>Here are some facts about major contributors to global emissions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>China:</strong> The largest emitter of CO2, accounting for about 31% of global emissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>United States:</strong> The second-largest emitter, contributing around 14% of global emissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>India:</strong> Rapidly growing economy and emissions, currently contributing about 7% of global emissions.</li>
                </ul>
